# looking for all occurrences of the word fast in README.md
$ rg fast README.md

# ripgrep's support for file types:
$ rg '`' --type scala

Configuration file:
RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH
$ cat $HOME/.ripgreprc

If we wanted, we could tell ripgrep to search anything but *.toml files:

$ rg clap -g '!*.toml'

rg def -g "*.scala"
# disable .gitignore handling
rg --no-ignore server_api
# search over hidden files and directories
rg --hidden server_api

All of these things can be toggled using various flags provided by ripgrep:

You can disable .gitignore handling with the --no-ignore flag.
Hidden files and directories can be searched with the --hidden flag.
Binary files can be searched via the --text (-a for short) flag. Be careful with this flag! Binary files may emit control characters to your terminal, which might cause strange behavior.
ripgrep can follow symlinks with the --follow (-L for short) flag.

Common options

-h: Show ripgrep's condensed help output.
--help: Show ripgrep's longer form help output. (Nearly what you'd find in ripgrep's man page, so pipe it into a pager!)
-i/--ignore-case: When searching for a pattern, ignore case differences. That is rg -i fast matches fast, fASt, FAST, etc.
-S/--smart-case: This is similar to --ignore-case, but disables itself if the pattern contains any uppercase letters. Usually this flag is put into alias or a config file.
-w/--word-regexp: Require that all matches of the pattern be surrounded by word boundaries. That is, given pattern, the --word-regexp flag will cause ripgrep to behave as if pattern were actually \b(?:pattern)\b.
-c/--count: Report a count of total matched lines.
--files: Print the files that ripgrep would search, but don't actually search them.
-a/--text: Search binary files as if they were plain text.
-U/--multiline: Permit matches to span multiple lines.
-z/--search-zip: Search compressed files (gzip, bzip2, lzma, xz, lz4, brotli, zstd). This is disabled by default.

-C/--context: Show the lines surrounding a match.

    + '(context-b)' # Context (before) options

    Ej. $ rg 'next_state.*retry_needed' -A 3

--sort path: Force ripgrep to sort its output by file name. (This disables parallelism, so it might be slower.)
-L/--follow: Follow symbolic links while recursively searching.
-M/--max-columns: Limit the length of lines printed by ripgrep.
--debug: Shows ripgrep's debug output. This is useful for understanding why a particular file might be ignored from search, or what kinds of configuration ripgrep is loading from the environment.
